# HAN 462 Health Information Systems

### Course description: 
The HAN-462 curriculum covers a  range of topics related to health information systems (HIS). Starting with the foundational concepts and  operational landscape of the most common types of HIS. The course addresses the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in healthcare, data requirements and standards, process capture in healthcare workflows, and the various types and roles of coding languages and database management solutions found within most HIS. Advanced topics include cloud computing, security, interoperability, and the application and adoption of artificial intelligence in HIS.

### Learning objectives: 
1. Identify and Explain HIS Core Concepts: Distinguish between various types of health information systems and their roles within the healthcare landscape

2. SDLC in Healthcare: Understand and articulate the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as they apply to healthcare, comparing traditional and modern methodologies such as Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.

3. Evaluate Data Management Tooling in HIS: Identify the types and sources of data in healthcare, apply coding standards like ICD and CPT, and assess the implications of data management practices within health informatics.

4. Map and Optimize Healthcare Workflows: Demonstrate the ability to capture, model, and analyze healthcare processes, utilizing techniques such as flowcharts, swimlanes, and process mining to improve efficiency and patient care.

5.  Coding Languages and Database Management: Evaluate the use of different coding languages and database solutions in HIS, understanding their application in the development and maintenance of health information systems.

6. Security and Interoperability Standards: Assess the importance of security frameworks and regulatory requirements in HIS, and develop strategies for achieving interoperability between disparate healthcare systems.

7. AI and Cloud Computing in HIS: Examine the role of artificial intelligence and cloud computing in healthcare, exploring how these technologies can be harnessed to enhance HIS functionality and patient outcomes.
