# HAN 462 Health Information Systems

### Course description: 
The HAN-462 curriculum covers a  range of topics related to health information systems (HIS). Starting with the foundational concepts and  operational landscape of the most common types of HIS. The course addresses the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in healthcare, data requirements and standards, process capture in healthcare workflows, and the various types and roles of coding languages and database management solutions found within most HIS. Advanced topics include cloud computing, security, interoperability, and the application and adoption of artificial intelligence in HIS.

### Learning objectives: 
1. Identify and Explain HIS Core Concepts: Distinguish between various types of health information systems and their roles within the healthcare landscape

2. SDLC in Healthcare: Understand and articulate the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as they apply to healthcare, comparing traditional and modern methodologies such as Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.

3. Evaluate Data Management Tooling in HIS: Identify the types and sources of data in healthcare, apply coding standards like ICD and CPT, and assess the implications of data management practices within health informatics.

4. Map and Optimize Healthcare Workflows: Demonstrate the ability to capture, model, and analyze healthcare processes, utilizing techniques such as flowcharts, swimlanes, and process mining to improve efficiency and patient care.

5.  Coding Languages and Database Management: Evaluate the use of different coding languages and database solutions in HIS, understanding their application in the development and maintenance of health information systems.

6. Security and Interoperability Standards: Assess the importance of security frameworks and regulatory requirements in HIS, and develop strategies for achieving interoperability between disparate healthcare systems.

7. AI and Cloud Computing in HIS: Examine the role of artificial intelligence and cloud computing in healthcare, exploring how these technologies can be harnessed to enhance HIS functionality and patient outcomes.

Students are expected to adhere to the university’s standards of academic integrity in all aspects of their coursework. Grades will be assigned based on the quality of work submitted, the accuracy of answers, the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, and engagement in the course. Timeliness of submission and adherence to assignment guidelines will also be factored into the grading of homework assignments.

#### 1. Homework Assignments (Individual) – 45%
Students will be assigned individual homework throughout the semester. These assignments are designed to reinforce the concepts taught in class and to provide practical experience in applying these concepts. The assignments will vary in format and may include problem sets, case studies, data analysis tasks, and short essays. Each assignment must be completed by the student independently unless otherwise stated.

#### 2. Midterm Exam – 25%
The midterm exam will assess the students' understanding of the material covered in the first half of the course. It will include a mix of multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and problem-solving exercises. The exam will test both theoretical knowledge and practical application of the course concepts.

#### 3. Final Exam – 25%
The final exam will be comprehensive, covering all the material taught throughout the course. Like the midterm, it will consist of multiple-choice and short-answer questions, along with problems or case studies that require a deeper application of the concepts learned. The final exam will evaluate the students' overall grasp of the course content and their ability to integrate and apply the various topics covered.

#### 4. Participation – 5%
Participation is a crucial component of this course. It includes regular attendance, engagement in class discussions, contribution to group activities, and responsiveness during lectures.
